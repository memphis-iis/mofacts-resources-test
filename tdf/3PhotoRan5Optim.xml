        <unitinstructions><![CDATA[<b>What is Photosynthesis?<br><br></b> <p>Plants need food but they do not have to wait on people or animals to provide for them. Most plants are autotrophs, able to make their own food whenever they need it. This is done using light and the process is called photosynthesis.
<br> <p>Before we go deeper into how photosynthesis works, let's sum it up. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food. To make food plants need carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. Let's take a look at how these are collected by plants. Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores in the leaves. These pores are called stomata. Plants must guard against drying out and so have evolved stomata to allow gas to enter and leave the leaf. Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves. Sunlight is absorbed by a green pigment in the leaves called chlorophyll.
<br><p>Now that the necessary ingredients have been collected, the food can be made. Photosynthesis uses six molecules of water plus six molecules of carbon dioxide to make one molecule of sugar and six molecules of oxygen. After photosynthesis, the oxygen passes through pores in the leaf and into the air. The food is a sugar that stays behind in the plant.
<br><p>Chlorophyll gives leaves their green color. Why is chlorophyll green? The answer has to do with wavelengths of light. White light which goes through a prism separates into different colors. These different colors are different wavelengths of light. Chlorophyll absorbs some of these wavelengths within the visible light spectrum, such as red (long wavelength) and blue (short wavelength) light. Green light is not absorbed but reflected by chlorophyll, making it appear green to our eyes.
<br><p>Chlorophyll absorbs the sun's energy. This energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. That oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to form glucose, also called sugar, the food for plants. Some of the glucose is used to provide energy for the growth and development of plants. The rest is stored in leaves, roots or fruits for later use by plants.
<br><br><b>The Process of Photosynthesis</b>
<br><p>Now we will get into the finer details of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis takes place in the leaves of plants. The leaves are made up of very small cells. Inside these cells are tiny structures called chloroplasts. The chloroplast is like a small town that houses every structure needed for photosynthesis. In the chloroplasts are thylakoids, which are special membranes containing chlorophyll and where the photosynthesis reactions actually take place. Thylakoids are stacked like pancakes in stacks called grana.
<br><p>Photosynthesis is a two-stage process. The first process is the light reactions, which requires the direct energy of light to make energy molecules for the second process, the dark reactions. The dark reactions can usually occur in the dark, if the energy molecules from the light reactions are present. The dark reactions use the products of the light reactions to form glucose.
<br><br><p>In the light reactions, light strikes chlorophyll in such a way as to excite electrons to a higher energy state. In a series of reactions the energy is converted (along an electron transport process) into ATP and NADPH. ATP and NADPH are molecules which carry energy. The energy in ATP and NADPH is used to make glucose in the dark reactions. Water is split into hydrogen and oxygen ions in the process, releasing oxygen as a by-product of the reaction.
<br><br><p>In the dark reactions, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is captured. The carbon dioxide is combined with hydrogen to form glucose using the energy made from the light reactions. The incorporation of carbon dioxide into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. Unlike the light reactions, the dark reactions take place outside the thylakoid and in the stroma. The stroma is a colorless fluid in the chloroplast that surrounds the thylakoid.
<br><br><p>The glucose created by photosynthesis stores energy. Plants use that energy by breaking down the glucose in a process called respiration. In respiration, oxygen combines with glucose to produce carbon dioxide and water. The energy released by respiration gives plants energy for growing and repairing. The carbon dioxide and water from respiration escape through the pores in the leaf.
<br><br><p>All living things release energy through respiration. Plants use oxygen during respiration just like animals.  Plants produce more oxygen than carbon dioxide because plants don't always use oxygen to break down glucose for energy. Glucose is soluble and moves throughout the plant. Most glucose is converted into building blocks like cellulose that make up the plant's body. But some glucose is also converted to insoluble starch, which stays inside cells. Starch can be turned back into glucose when it's needed for energy.
<br><br><b>Implications of Photosynthesis</b>
<br><p>Some of the glucose that plants produce during photosynthesis is stored in fruits and roots. This is why we are able to eat carrots, potatoes, apples, water melons and all the others. These foods provide energy for humans and animals.
<br><p>Oxygen that is produced during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. This oxygen is what we breathe and we cannot live without it. While it is important that photosynthesis provides food and oxygen, its impact on our daily lives is far more extensive. All of our energy for growth, development and physical activity comes from eating food from plants and animals. Animals obtain energy from eating plants. Plants obtain energy from glucose made during photosynthesis.
<br><p>Our major sources of energy such as natural gas, coal, and oil were made millions of years ago from the remains of dead plants and animals which we already know got their energy from photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is also responsible for balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen during the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is so essential to life on earth that most living organisms, including humans, cannot survive without it.]]> </unitinstructions>
