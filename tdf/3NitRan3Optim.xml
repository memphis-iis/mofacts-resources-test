        <unitinstructions><![CDATA[<b>The Nitrogen Cycle</b> <br><br> <p>Nitrogen is a versatile element. It comes in many different chemical states. It has no color, odor, or taste. It can move through air, soil, and water. Nitrogen is a building block of life. Nature uses it to make DNA and proteins, and all plants need nitrogen to live and grow. The movement of nitrogen through the environment is called the nitrogen cycle.
About 78% of the air we breathe is nitrogen gas. It comes from the atmosphere, but it can't be used by organisms in that form. This is because a strong chemical bond connects nitrogen atoms. Most plants can't use this atmospheric nitrogen because they can't break that bond. The bonded, inert nature of nitrogen gas makes all of it in the atmosphere seem useless. Fortunately, nature solved the problem. As you will see, nitrogen is abundant in ecosystems.
Nitrogen cycles through ecosystems in five steps. These are nitrogen fixation, nitrogen uptake, nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification. At each step, nitrogen chemically changes in what is called a nitrogen transformation. How this is accomplished is explained in the five steps below.
<br><br> <b>Nitrogen Fixation</b><br> <p>The first step is nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is when organisms convert nitrogen gas to compounds usable by plants. These organisms are called nitrogen-fixers, and are usually bacteria. They don't break the strong chemical bond of nitrogen directly. Instead, they combine the nitrogen gas with hydrogen or oxygen, and form a new, usable compound. Soil bacteria from the genus Rhizobium do this. They take nitrogen from the air and convert it to ammonium by metabolic processes. Nitrogen is still in the ammonium, but it's changed its chemical form. In the ocean, blue-green algae are an important nitrogen fixer too. Natural events like lightning and lava flows also fix a little nitrogen by breaking the bonds of nitrogen atoms. Now free, the nitrogen can combine and form other compounds.
Recently, humans have become an important source of fixed nitrogen. Burning fossil fuels, using nitrogen fertilizers, and growing legumes all fix nitrogen. In fact, humans now fix more nitrogen than all natural sources combined. This extra nitrogen can have bad effects on the environment. One example is with fertilizer, which is made from nitrogen. Humans grow crops with fertilizer. But if it rains, fertilizer may run off the farm and into rivers. The rivers take the fertilizer into the ocean where algae feed on the nitrogen in it. The algae bloom and suck oxygen out of the water. This forms what are called dead zones, and hundreds exist. Dead zones are terrible for fish and marine life.
<br><br>
<b>Nitrogen Uptake</b><br> <p>The second step is nitrogen uptake. Nitrogen uptake is the incorporation of fixed nitrogen, like ammonium, into a plant. Plants can absorb the nitrogen from the soil or from bacteria. In the soil, other bacteria have fixed nitrogen as ammonium or nitrate. Plants absorb this with their roots. It's the main way they get nitrogen. Plants use it to create their stems, leaves, and roots. But there is another way plants get nitrogen. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria like Rhizobium often form symbiotic relationships with host plants. This symbiosis occurs in legumes (beans and peas). In this relationship, the legume lets nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in its roots and gives it food. In exchange, the plant gets some of the nitrogen the bacteria fix. Meanwhile, humans get their nitrogen by eating plants or other animals.
<br><br> <b>Nitrogen Mineralization</b> <p>The third step is nitrogen mineralization. Mineralization is the conversion of organic nitrogen back to ammonium. Nitrogen occurs in two forms: inorganic (ammonium) and organic (stems, leaves, proteins). Plants can only use inorganic nitrogen as food. They use it to make leaves, stems, and roots and turn it into organic nitrogen. When plants die and decay, the organic nitrogen stored in leaves and stems can't be used by other plants. But it can be eaten and broken down back to inorganic nitrogen by bacteria and fungi. One example is a mushroom growing on a dead log. Organic nitrogen in the log's wood is turned back to an inorganic form like ammonium. That is mineralization in action. As ammonium, nitrogen can repeat this part of the cycle and be used by plants again. Or, it can change into nitrate by the step of nitrification.
<br><br> <b>Nitrification</b> <p>The fourth step is nitrification. Nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrate by bacteria. The bacteria gain energy from this reaction but need oxygen to do it. So, nitrification happens mostly in environments with more oxygen, like topsoil. But nitrate doesn't stick to soil easily when water's around. A heavy rain can wash nitrates into rivers or sink it deeper through soil into groundwater. Water carries around nitrate like a taxi cab. Too much nitrate in the groundwater is bad for human health. But for plants, nitrate is a great nutrient. It may end up in plant leaves if it's not washed away.
<br><br> <b>Denitrification</b> <p>The final step is denitrification. Denitrification changes nitrate back into nitrogen gas and is done by denitrifying bacteria. These bacteria often live in swamps and lakes and need very little oxygen. It's almost the reverse of nitrogen fixation. Whereas fixation steals nitrogen from the air, denitrification gives it back. Once converted to nitrogen gas, the molecule escapes into the sky. 
Only denitrification removes nitrogen from ecosystems. It keeps nitrogen in balance. Without it, nitrogen compounds could build up to toxic levels in the soil. While helpful, denitrification can do harm. It makes nitric oxide and nitrous oxide gases. They cause smog, acid rain, and thin the ozone layer. However, humans have learned to harness denitrification. To clean water, water treatment plants have to remove the nitrates. To do this they pass the water through filters full of denitrifying bacteria. The bacteria change the nitrate to a gas and it leaves the water.
The nitrogen cycle is one of nature's most elegant sleights-of-hand. It shuttles nitrogen from air to soil to plants and back again.]]> </unitinstructions>
